# Pacman Exercise
## Description
  In this exercise, Pacmen are created at a click of a button and move across a confine space at random velocities. Pacmen will bounce back if touch the edge of the screen.
## How to Run
  Download all files to the same folder on your machine and open index.html on your web browser. Click on Create Pacman button to creat a Pacman and click the Start Game to move the pacman.
## Future Improvements
  I want to have the Pacmen also change direction, and maybe color, when they collide with each other.
